Layout Components
<div> tag: This is a basic block-level element used to divide web page content.

Semantic tags: Tags with meaning, like <header>, <nav>, <section>, and <footer>, improve code readability and help search engines understand the page structure.

<ul> and <li> tags: These are used to structure list-based content, such as navigation menus.

Real-world Website Layout Example (bing.com)
The video uses bing.com as an example to show how a real web page is structured.

Header: The top part of the page, including the navigation menu (<nav>) and logo.

Section: The main content area, which uses various <div> or <ul> tags to create different content blocks.

Footer: The bottom part of the page, including copyright information and additional links.

Styling and Spacing with CSS
Adding a background color: The video shows how to visually separate each section (<header>, <section>, <footer>) by assigning a background color.

Adjusting spacing (Margin and Padding):

Margin: Sets the outer space around an element.

Padding: Sets the inner space within an element.

Value input methods: You can specify spacing with one value (all directions), two values (top/bottom and left/right), or four values (top, right, bottom, left).

Removing default spacing: To remove the default margins and padding applied by browsers to the <body> tag, you can set margin: 0; and padding: 0;.

Units: The video introduces px (pixels) and % (percent) as spacing units, recommending that beginners use px.
