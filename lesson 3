Getting Started with CSS

CSS uses rules composed of three parts—a selector, a property, and a value—to specify the style of HTML elements.

Selector: Chooses the HTML element to apply the style to. For example, h1 selects all <h1> tags.
Property: Specifies the type of style to change. For instance, color changes the font color, font-family changes the font, and background-color changes the background color.
Value: Assigns a specific value to the property. For example, red means the color red, and Arial refers to the Arial font.

Style Application Examples
You write CSS code inside a <style> tag, which is placed within the <head> tag of your HTML document.

HTML
<head>
  <style>
    /* Write your CSS code here. */
  </style>
</head>
Example: To change the font color of <h1> tags to red, you would write the following:

CSS
h1 {
  color: red;
}
Example: To change both the background color and font, you would write this:

CSS
p {
  background-color: lightgray;
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}

The reason for specifying multiple fonts in font-family is to provide a fallback font in case the user's computer 
doesn't have the first font installed. sans-serif tells the browser to use a default sans-serif font available on the computer.
